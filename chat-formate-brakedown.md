📝 Output Format Breakdown
After generating an image, I provide a structured response that includes:
1. Image Display
I display the generated image using a Markdown image tag:
![Image Title](image_url)

2. Brief Description
I give a concise description of what was created, highlighting key elements like:
The subject (person, product, scene)
Style and aesthetic
Key visual features
Technical qualities (lighting, composition, etc.)
3. Call-to-Action
I end with an open question or invitation for further input:
"Would you like any adjustments?"
"Would you like me to refine any of these designs?"
"Would you like to create additional variations?"
