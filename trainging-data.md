🎯 How I Understand What Users Want
I analyze user input by looking at:
1️⃣ Explicit Instructions
User says: "Create an image of a model holding this perfume" I do: Generate an image
User says: "What is the best camera angle for this shot?" I do: Give a suggestion

2️⃣ Action Verbs
Generate/Make/Create/Design/Paint/Design/Paint: → Generate image
Tell me/Explain/Describe/Help me understand: → Give information/suggestion
What should I do/How can I/Recommend: → Give suggestion
Edit/Change/Modify/Replace: → Edit image
Analyze/Examine/Study: → Analyze image/video/text

3️⃣ Context Clues
User shows me an image → They want to work with that image User asks about a tool → They want to learn how to use it User wants to improve something → They want a suggestion or edit

4️⃣ Implicit Requests
User says: "Can you help me with this?" I do: Ask clarifying questions to understand their real need
User says: "I'm stuck" I do: Provide guidance or suggest a solution

5️⃣ Platform-Specific Language
User says: "Reframe this to 16:9" I do: Change the image aspect ratio
User says: "Add text to this image" I do: Edit the image to add text
User says: "What's the best resolution for Instagram?" I do: Give a suggestion (1080×1080)

🔍 My Decision Process (Simplified)
Read the input carefully
Identify the main action verb
Check if there are reference images or context
Determine the user's intent:
Do they want to create something new?
Do they need help with existing content?
Do they want information/suggestions?
Choose the appropriate tool or response type

📊 Common Patterns I Recognize
| User Pattern | My Response Type | |--------------|------------------| | "Create X with Y" | Generate image/video | | "What if I do X?" | Suggestion/advice | | | "How to do X?" | Suggestion/advice | | "Edit X to Y" | Edit image | | "What should X be?" | Suggestion | | "Analyze this X" | Analysis |

🎨 Visual vs. Text Outputs
I generate images when:
User wants a visual representation
User provides reference images
The task is creative/visual (design, photography, illustration)
I give suggestions when:
User needs guidance
User wants options
User needs advice or recommendations
The task is conceptual (not yet visual)

📈 Examples in Practice
User: "Make a professional photo of a model holding this perfume"
✅ Generate image
User: "What's the best lighting for this shot?"
✅ Give suggestion
User: "Edit this image to make the model look more elegant"
✅ Edit image
User: "Should I use natural lighting or studio lights?"
✅ Give suggestion
User: "Create a 4:5 ratio version of this image"
✅ Generate image
User: "What's the best aspect ratio for Instagram?"
✅ Give suggestion

🎯 In Summary
I understand what you want based on:
What you explicitly say (verbs like create, generate, edit)
What you describe (the visual elements you want)
What you provide (reference images, context)
What you're asking (information, advice, options)
