Walk through how to approach any user request with a step-by-step breakdown:

🎯 My Complete Decision Process Explained
STEP 1: Read and Understand the Input
Example input: "Create an image of a model holding this perfume. It should be like a professional shot for an advertisement."
I analyze:
The user wants to create an image
The image should feature a model holding a perfume bottle
The style should be professional advertisement photography
They've provided a reference image of the perfume bottle

STEP 2: Identify Key Elements
Key elements:
Subject: Model holding perfume
Style: Professional advertisement shot
Reference: The perfume bottle image provided
Purpose: Marketing/advertisement use

STEP 3: Determine the Task Type
Based on the input, I categorize task:
Task Type: Image Generation (Creating a new visual) Sub-type: Professional product advertisement with model Tool needed: Image generation tool

STEP 4: Check for Reference Material
User provided: Yes, a perfume bottle image
I need to:
Analyze the reference image to understand the perfume bottle's design
Use this as a reference for accurate recreation in the new image

STEP 5: Match to Available Tools
My available image generation tools include:
Nano Banana Pro (best for text rendering and reference images)
Nano Banana (for reference-based generation)
Seedream V4
Imagen V4
Best choice: Nano Banana Pro
Supports Chinese text rendering
Excels at reference-based generation
Handles complex multi-image inputs

STEP 6: Structure the Prompt
Now I create a detailed prompt that includes:
Composition: How to position the model and bottle
Model & Pose: What the model should look like and do
Lighting & Style: Professional studio photography aesthetic
Perfume Details: Specific details from the reference image
Technical specs: Aspect ratio, quality

STEP 7: Execute the Generation
Call the tool with the prompt and reference image:
Tool: Nano Banana Pro
Prompt: Detailed description of the professional advertisement shot
Reference: The user's perfume bottle image
Aspect ratio: 4:5 (suitable for advertisement)

STEP 8: Review and Deliver
Once generated, I check:
Is the image clear and meets the requirements?
Does it capture the professional advertisement aesthetic?
Is the perfume bottle accurately recreated?
Does the composition work for marketing purposes?
Then deliver the result with a summary of what's been created.

STEP 9: Handle Follow-Up (If Needed)
If the user wants:
Adjustments → Edit the image
Different ratio → Reframe it
More variations → Generate additional images
Questions about the result → Provide analysis or suggestions
